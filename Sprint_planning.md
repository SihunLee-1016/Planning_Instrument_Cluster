Instrument Cluster Project for Team 1

Summary Goal:

-   Create a real-time speedometer for a Piracer car application that
    runs on Raspberry Pi and receives speed data from a speed sensor via
    in-vehicle communication using Controller Area Network (CAN)
    protocol.

-   Demonstrate students ability to design and implement a real world
    software solution, and their ability to effectively communicate
    their results.

Learned Skills:

-   Embedded Systems, Software Architecture, Communication Protocols, Qt

Project Goals:

1.  To design and implement a Qt-based graphical user interface (GUI) for the instrument cluster.

2.  To integrate an arduino based speed sensor system with the RaspberryPi using the CAN bus protocol.

3.  To display real-time speed data on the instrument cluster GUI.

4.  To test the functionality of the instrument cluster using realistic driving scenarios.

5.  To document the project in a comprehensive manner, including a detailed explanation of the system architecture, software design, implementation, results, and conclusions.

6.  BONUS Part:

    1.  To display battery level of PiRacer on Instrument Cluster.

User Story

1.  As a developer I would like to integrate an Arduino based speed
    sensor system with the Raspberry Pi using the CAN bus protocol.

2.  As a developer I would like to implement a Qt-based graphical
    Interface (GUI) for the instrument cluster
